for a competition involving local artists in the cultural enrichment of their communities. Eddy was awarded the commission to execute a large mural on the exposed west wall of the Inman Square Firehouse. The result is a three times life-size portrait of all members of Engine Company No. 5 in firefighting gear, along with the company dalmatian, posed around one of their pump trucks. Also included in the scene are two volunteer firemen straight out of history. Benjamin Franklin, who founded the first volunteer fire department in the country, stands on the running board in a pair of red sneakers. George Washington, who resided in Cambridge during the Siege of Boston, is holding a couple of pails. Eddy left the natural brick surrounding the mural exposed, in tribute to the handsome, Italian-style firehouse.","Commission":"City of Cambridge, Public Art Collection","Materials":"Painting","Loc_Detail":"1384 Cambridge Street","Location":"Inman Square Firehouse","Year":1976,"Latitude":42.3736,"Size":"15' x 25\"","ArtID":22}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1033600002359,42.3700199995575]},"type":"Feature","id":31,"properties":{"marker-color":"#0433ff","marker-size":"medium","marker-symbol":"","Category":"Mural","First_Name":"Michael","Last_Name":"Glier","Title":"\"Town Green\"","Gender":"Male","Interior_E":"Interior","Longitude":-71.10336,"About":"Glier is painting three large walls in the building's two-story atrium to transform the space into an indoor \"garden.\" The art is organized around four themes representing ideal missions of the municipal departments that occupy the building: 'Transparency,' 'Flow,' 'Growth,' and 'Pleasure.' The images relate to these concepts as they also give snapshots of the cityscape: birds and roses; ivy climbing the walls; bicyclists; rowers; a girl lying in the grass, reading; a view through the wall into an employee lunchroom, revealing office workers on a coffee break. Besides painting three large walls in the atrium, Glier will paint panels for public spaces on the upper floors, repeating some of the motifs developed in the atrium. In addition, Glier has worked with the building architects to make changes to the design of a central staircase, the floor pattern, and lighting.","Commission":"City of Cambridge, Public Art Collection","Materials":"Paintings","Loc_Detail":"City Hall Annex on the corner of Broadway and Inman St.","Location":"City Hall Annex","Year":2004,"Latitude":42.37002,"Size":"Not Available Mulitple Floors","ArtID":31}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1015000001815,42.373999999606525]},"type":"Feature","id":72,"properties":{"marker-color":"#0433ff","marker-size":"medium","marker-symbol":"","Category":"Sculpture","First_Name":"Jock, Suzanne","Last_Name":"Reynolds, Helmuth","Title":"\"Vellucci Plaza Design\"","Gender":"1 Female, 1 Male","Interior_E":"Exterior","Longitude":-71.1015,"About":"As part of the Cambridge Street Improvements, artists Jock Reynolds and Suzanne Hellmuth have served as lead-designers of Vellucci Plaza in Inman Square.

Three 18\" high granite planters will be placed in asymmetrical formation, with wood platforms on top for seating. A variety of plants, including a series of white Birches, will reflect the strong tradition of gardening in the neighborhood, while also providing barriers from the loud traffic on both sides of the plaza. A gridded wall along the back will provide a barrier for the direct abutters. The scale of the open spaces between the planters has been determined to encourage groups to assemble for meetings and performances.","Commission":"City of Cambridge, Public Art Collection","Materials":"Concrete","Loc_Detail":"Located where Beacon, Hampshire and Cambridge Street meet","Location":"Vellucci Plaza, Inman Square","Year":2006,"Latitude":42.374,"Size":"Not Available","ArtID":72}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.10380000005736,42.37060000003084]},"type":"Feature","id":81,"properties":{"marker-color":"#0433ff","marker-size":"medium","marker-symbol":"","Category":"Sculpture","First_Name":"Robin","Last_Name":"Shores","Title":"Untitled","Gender":"Female","Interior_E":"Exterior","Longitude":-71.1038,"About":"Originally, these four bollards (thick posts) served an unadorned, practical purpose: to protect students from busy Broadway traffic.
