Eddy was awarded the commission to execute a large mural on the exposed west wall of the Inman Square Firehouse. The result is a three times life-size portrait of all members of Engine Company No. 5 in firefighting gear, along with the company dalmatian, posed around one of their pump trucks. Also included in the scene are two volunteer firemen straight out of history. Benjamin Franklin, who founded the first volunteer fire department in the country, stands on the running board in a pair of red sneakers. George Washington, who resided in Cambridge during the Siege of Boston, is holding a couple of pails. Eddy left the natural brick surrounding the mural exposed, in tribute to the handsome, Italian-style firehouse.",

The images relate to these concepts as they also give snapshots of the cityscape: birds and roses; ivy climbing the walls; bicyclists; rowers; a girl lying in the grass, reading; a view through the wall into an employee lunchroom, revealing office workers on a coffee break. Besides painting three large walls in the atrium, Glier will paint panels for public spaces on the upper floors, repeating some of the motifs developed in the atrium. In addition, Glier has worked with the building architects to make changes to the design of a central staircase, the floor pattern, and lighting.",

As a Peace Corps volunteer Robin Shores worked in India and Africa, and currently teaches English in Bangladesh. An MFA graduate of the University of Buffalo, he has taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston as well as Boston University.
